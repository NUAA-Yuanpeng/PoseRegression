# Regression-based 3D Pose Estimation for Texture-less Objects

**The code is coming soon, please stay tuned.**

### Introduction

In this paper, we propose a novel network structure to estimate 3D pose for texture-less objects. The network contains two parts, the triplet network, to extract expected features from images; and the regression network, to directly regress the 3D pose using the features output by the triplet network.
